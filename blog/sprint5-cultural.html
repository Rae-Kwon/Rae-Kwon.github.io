                <h1 id="head">Foundations Final Reflection.</h1>
                <div id="intro"> Now that the foundations portion of studying with Enspiral Dev Academy has finished I spent some time looking back and reflecting on my learning journey. Emphasis was placed on the core curriculum as it is a unique aspect of learning at EDA. </div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>Three new things I learned about myself</h2>
                <div id="three-new-things">
                    <ul>
                        <li>I learned that I am more patient than I thought I was.</li>
                        <li>I learned that sometimes it is alright to take time away from the code and come back to it later.</li>
                        <li>I learned that failure is a part of success and that failing will help in answering those problems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <div id="values-empathy-selfawareness"> I think that the values, empathy and self awareness really help a person in understanding how to learn and program, and also how to learn and program with other people.</div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <div id="surprised-core-learning"> The thing that surprised me the most was how therapeutic it felt to journal and reflect on a consistent basis. I had previously not reflected consistently like this and I feel it was a good exercise in learning more about myself.</div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <div id="challengin-core-learning"> The most challenge aspect for me was being able to get over my self consciousness in writing down my thoughts. I learned that my answer doesn’t have to be “perfect” and that I should just write down what I’m thinking and how I feel.</div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>Why do you think EDA, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <div id="EDA-core-learning"> I think EDA is focusing a lot on core learning because by doing so it is helping us students understand ourselves and our learning habits. It is also very beneficial to working in a team environment to be able to self reflect and know what you do well and what you can improve on. That is why I think that EDA focuses on the core learning so much.</div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? </h2>
                <div id="core-learning-waste"> Like I’ve said in earlier answers I feel that the reflection time and learning about different aspects of human emotion and intelligence through the core curriculum has really helped in understanding how I learn and how I can move forward with learning. I think taking time away from programming, sometimes, can be beneficial when stuck or frustrated.</div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h2>Finally</h2>
                <div id="conclusion"> I have so far enjoyed the core aspects of learning and I feel has improved my understanding of myself and specifically how I learn in the context of programming and problem solving. I hope I can continue reflecting, whether that's through a blog or on pen and paper.</div>
