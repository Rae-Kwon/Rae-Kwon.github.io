                <div id="intro"> Life would be a lot easier if emotions were taken out of a lot of situations, but life just wouldn’t be as fun if emotions were taken away. This is why we need to be able to learn about and understand our emotions and Emotional Intelligence. By doing so we will be able to enjoy life a little more and also further ourselves in whatever goal or target that we have set for ourselves.</div>

                <h2>What is EQ, and also, what is IQ?</h2>
                <div id="eq-iq"> IQ or Intelligence Quotient is the measure of a person’s intelligence through a standardised test that is conducted. EQ or Emotional Quotient is the ability to manage and understand your own emotions in a positive way to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.</div>

                <h2>EQ vs IQ</h2>
                <div id="eq-iq-differences"> The key difference is that IQ is all about a person’s knowledge of things whereas EQ is about a person’s understanding of their own emotions. This is important as it can help when managing your emotions during a difficult period and allow you to channel those emotions into something positive that helps in overcoming difficult tasks or achieving a goal you may have set out.</div>

                <br>

                <h2>Finally</h2>
                <div id="conclusion"> Being able to understand how to utilise emotions to our benefit is a highly important skill. It is something that needs to be worked on constantly. Having learned about Emotional Intelligence I think it will be of huge importance to me during my studies in programming. Hopefully, by learning and understanding more about my own Emotional Intelligence I will be able to achieve my goal of getting into a software development role.</div>
