                        <div class="post-content">While learning web development you may have come across classes and IDs. When you type out some HTML and use these classes and IDs you might notice that they both do the same thing when you go to style it in a CSS file. You might be able to use classes and IDs interchangebly on a simple website with only a few div containers, but when you are working with a bigger website, the browser might not be so kind as to let you use them any way you want. So what is the difference between a class and and ID, and what are the best practices in using them?</div>

                        <div class="post-content"> Having been given the task of self-evaluation and identifying my personal values, I quickly looked up the recommended Myers Briggs test. After looking through a few of them, I discovered a website called 16personalities.com. This website gives a free assessment of what your personality is like within the Myers Briggs guidelines. So I took the test and got some revealing answers.
